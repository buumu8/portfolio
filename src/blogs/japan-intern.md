From October to November 2025, I had the incredible opportunity to intern in Kobe, Japan—a chapter of my life that turned out to be far more memorable and heartwarming than I ever expected.

## Living in Kobe: Convenience at Its Finest

I was provided with a newly furnished apartment, perfectly located with easy access to both the subway and train stations. The neighborhood itself was wonderfully convenient: lined with cozy restaurants, late-night convenience stores, and everything I needed within a short walk. It didn’t take long for the area to feel like home.

My workplace was just a 15-minute walk away—close enough to enjoy a peaceful morning stroll every day. The office environment was equally comforting. My colleagues treated me with kindness from the very first day, making me feel supported and welcomed.

## Working in Japanese for the First Time

This internship was my first experience using Japanese professionally. Even though I passed the JLPT N1 years ago, working entirely in Japanese was still a big challenge. Understanding everything—especially when people slipped into their local dialects—pushed me outside my comfort zone daily. But that challenge became one of the most valuable parts of the experience, and I learned so much more than I expected.

## Exploring Kansai and Beyond

On weekends and days off, I went on countless trips and ate way too much good food—no regrets. Traveling in Japan is remarkably easy, especially with the JR Pass. Thanks to the amazing train network, I could take spontaneous day trips to many nearby cities: **Osaka, Kyoto, Nara, Shiga, Okayama, Tottori, Hiroshima**—you name it.

One of my favorite things to do while traveling was visiting local *onsens*. After long days of walking and exploring, soaking in a hot spring felt almost magical—relaxing, refreshing, and uniquely Japanese.

## As the Days Pass…

Time flew by faster than I expected. Before I knew it, my two months in Kobe were coming to an end. There’s still so much more I wish I could do, so many places left to explore, and so many foods I haven’t tried yet. But even so, these past two months have given me unforgettable memories that I will carry with me forever.

**Kobe, and everyone who made my stay special—thank you.**
